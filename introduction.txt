Purpose:

To raise people's awareness of techniques that can deceive deep learning models, we designed this "Stealth T-shirt" with the adversarial pattern on the chest to fool an object detector. The T-shirt is capable of hiding a person who wears it from an open-source object detector.

What is thisï¼Ÿ

This a T-shirt with adversarial pattern printed on the chest capable of fooling an object detector. The adversarial pattern is generated via known gradients of the model.

How does it work?

By wearing it and showing the adversarial pattern in front of a camera and its object detector, the person who wears it will disappear. Whereas the person who doesn't wear the T-shirt is still under object detector detection.
